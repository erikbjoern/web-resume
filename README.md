Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Coming into the tech industry at this time is wonderful, as I see the endless potential of modern web technologies, and there are so many tools and enhancements that make life easier for developers. But as a newcomer diving almost straight into React for example, it was sometimes hard to understand how things work - why do we need libraries, what is WebPack for, how does the browser work? 

Having used React almost from day one of the bootcamp I took earlier this year, it was interesting to make this little web page without any frameworks or libraries, to be reminded of the capabilities and limitations of plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And I really understand why we have libraries and frameworks, that's noticable even for a web page as small as this one. What I noticed most clearly is the difficulties to implement modularity such as partial rendering. I wouldn't want to build anything larger than this without extending the dependencies.
