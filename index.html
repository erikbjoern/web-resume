          Equivalent to high school education, with specialisation in design and
          product development. Main subjects were math, construction, technology
          and physical science which I enjoyed a lot. I see many correlations
          between math and programming.

        <h2>Work life experience</h2>
        <h3>Carpenter</h3>
        <p class="heading-4">
          <span><strong>Mark & Grund AB</strong>, Vännäs, Sweden</span><span>Sep 2019 - Feb 2020</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a carpenter in a construction groundworks company I would mostly
          build fences, sandboxes and assemble playground equipment in
          connection to laying the foundation for schoolyards, parking lots and
          so on. We also built the exterior of an extension of a villa, and
          quite often I would do groundworks tasks with the others, such as
          preparing the ground for asphalt and casting bicycle stands.

        <h3>Nursing assistant</h3>
        <p class="heading-4">
          <span><strong>Umeå municipality</strong>, Tavelsjö, Sweden</span><span>Feb - Aug 2019</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in home care service, my main responsibilities were to give
          medicine including insulin, cook and serve food, give social support,
          clean and help with personal hygiene.

        <h3>Odd jobs</h3>
        <p class="heading-4">Norway and Sweden</span><span>Oct 2017 - Feb 2019</p>
        <p>
          For a period of about 18 months, I got the opportunity to work with a
          lot of different jobs, with everything from chicken production, waste
          disposal and shoveling snow off of roofs to graphic design and
          woodwork. It gave me very different and valuable experiences and I
          learned that having the opportunity to keep improving and learning is
          very important to me.
        </p>
        <h3>Social/youth worker</h3>
        <p class="heading-4">
          <span><strong>Gjennestad VGS</strong>, Stokke, Norway</span><span>Aug 2016 - June 2017</span>
        </p>

          My responsibilities were to plan out and arrange activities and events
          for students at a boarding school, and in other ways contribute to the
          social environment there. The work hours were mostly evenings and
          weekends.
